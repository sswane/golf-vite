# React + TypeScript + Vite

Play golf games with friends and handicaps.

Created via `npm create vite@latest golf-vite -- --template react-ts`

Project still includes some css files from the starter - should be revisited later.

## Current App
Currently the app has hardcoded values for 4 players and 1 course. This is what the site currently looks like when running:

![original](./screenshots/original.png)

After clicking the "Begin" button, a list of holes will appear:

![show-holes](./screenshots/show-holes.png)

Clicking on a hole will show specific info for that hole. It takes in user input & automatically calculates the net score for each player.

![edit-hole](./screenshots/edit-hole.png)
